                    This is a project about getting a better understanding of how to use React.
                    Simple, yet allows me to grasp and practice the concepts we learned in class.
                    I struggled more with creating the routes and ended up getting lost in my code, 
                    more than a few times. 
                </p>

            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default About;
