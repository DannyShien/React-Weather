                    This project is about getting a better understanding of how to use React.
                    Simple, yet allows me to grasp and practice the concepts we learned. <br />
                    <br />
                    # Challenges: <br />
                        - Creating the routes and ended up getting lost in my code, 
                            more than a few times. <br />
                        - Chaining down the  with APIs to get specific information. <br />

                </p>
