# RAIN OR SHINE 2.0
### Your basic, nothing fancy, weather app. :grimacing:

## Summary
This simple weather application play around with OpenWeatherMap's API, utilizing React. 

Type the city in the search bar, for its weather information to display. Once the API fetches the JSON data, you will have current and forecast weather information shown. Current weather shows the city that has been searched, weather condition, main temperature, weather condition's icon, humidity, wind speed and cloud percentage. Forecast weather will display up to 16 "forecast objects", with 3 hr intervals(OWM's accessebility). Within each "forecast objects", you get timeframe(in hours), weather condition's icon and  main temperature. 

## Build Motivation
This application is built just for fun. I want to continue practicing and understanding different ways of using React.  Still a work in progress and will most likely build on top this in the future. Had a lot of struggles and complications but overall a great learning exerience.
